## Overview

As augmented reality becomes accessible to everyone through the phones in their pocket, how might we dissolve prior divides between the digital and the public urban experience? This is an experimental and interdisciplinary class to explore how emerging technologies can be applied to solve timeless user needs in the city. Through partnership with [TwoTwelve](http://www.twotwelve.com/), a public information design firm, we will examine current wayfinding needs based on real-world scenarios in urban signage, hospitals, and transportation systems. Through readings, discussion, and hands‐on projects, students will learn principles of human‐computer interaction, mobile app design, and augmented reality design. We will survey current technology trends and examine their long-term implications for design and for society. Students will develop skills in user research, rapid‐prototyping, and usability testing, using industry prototyping software such as Sketch, Invision, SnapLens Studio as well as paper and cardboard prototyping.
