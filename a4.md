# Assignment 4: Final Project
<br>

- “Quarantine Times”: physical-digital spaces for emotional connection; design for play?
- AR Interaction: affordance, senses, aesthetics (Pick a specific set of spatial information)
- Critical Design: challenge status quo/assumptions

How could the design of the digital user experience work in tandem with the spatial environment, which is likely "smart" and "modular", etc., to facilitate desireable interactions?

What is the information experience in cities of the future?

Form teams of up to 4 people, teams of one is perfectly acceptable.

For students who are interested, there's an opportunity to publish with [The Interaction Review by Prototypr.io](https://blog.prototypr.io/theinteractionreview/home) on Medium.com.

### Week 1: A4.1 Ideas

Choose one (and only one) of the prompts, create 3 divergent directions and present your concept in a [Miro board](https://miro.com/).

Submit your [Miro URL](https://forms.gle/EDzhzmCAJPhydBog6) by 4/7 Wed 6pm. In class, you will present by sharing your screen, so you can count on being able to control your board. Aim for a 5min. presentation.

### Week 2: A4.2 Refine

Based on feedback in class on A4.1, refined your ideas.

### Week 3: A4.3 Prototype

Create concept videos / prototype your user experience.

### Week 5: A4.5 Evaluate + Conclusion + Documentation

Test/show your prototype with 2 or 3 users.

Deliverable: final presentation according to this outline:

- **Introduction** -- A succinct definition of your chosen user information concept in public space, and the motivation for solving it in AR.
- **Inspiration** -- Observations of interactions or real-world scenarios today that motivate your concept.
- **Explorations** -- Ideas you attempted but possibly abandoned.
- **Concept Video(s)** -- 1~3 video(s), aim for 1~2min. each, that illustrates your concepts (more videos if you're showing variants of an interaction; longer length if you only have one video.)
- **Evaluation** -- Two or three select quotes of user reactions.
- **Future Work** -- How you would extend or refine your project if you had more time.
