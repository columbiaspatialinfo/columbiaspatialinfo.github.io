# Assignment 4: Final Project
<br>

As mixed reality technologies seem to remove more and more of the need for people to meet in person, what are reasons to continue to interact with each other in physical space?

How could the design of the digital user experience work in tandem with the built environment, which is likely "smart" and "modular", etc., to facilitate desireable interactions?

What is the information experience in cities of the future?

Site selection will be by assignment according to your ranked preferences; our goal is to ensure both that we explore a variety of directions as a class, and everyone is excited about what they're working on.

We will then introduce you to professionals with topic-area expertise, e.g. an information architect at the MTA.

For students who are interested, there's an opportunity to publish with [The Interaction Review by Prototypr.io](https://blog.prototypr.io/theinteractionreview/home) on Medium.com.

### Week 1: A4.1 Proposal

Do preliminary research, observe, and decide which user needs you will focus on in your chosen space.

Deliverables: preliminary user journey, preliminary problem statement

### Week 2: A4.2 Research

Conduct interviews with users as well as experts, design provocations and synthesize a conceptual framework you'll use to guide your design decisions for the rest of the project.

Deliverables: personas, user framework (e.g. axes), revised user journey, revised problem statement

### Week 3: A4.3 Storyboard + Concept

Storyboard possible solutions, and choose one to develop into a concept video that illustrates your ideal user experience.

### Week 4: A4.4 Prototype

Prototype your user experience (perhaps a subsection of your concept video.)

### Week 5: A4.5 Evaluate + Conclusion + Documentation

Test your prototype with users.

Deliverable: final presentation according to this outline:

- **Introduction** -- A succinct definition of your chosen user information problem in public space, and the motivation for solving it in AR.
- **User Insights** -- Summarize what you learned about your users and the framework you defined to guide your design decisions.
- **Proposed Solution** -- One-sentence "poster" description of the experience you designed, and a user journey diagram capturing how your solution fits into the holistic user experience.
- **Concept Video** -- One video that illustrates your ideal user experience.
- **Demo Video** -- One video that shows what users saw when you tested your prototype (video should be from a first person (user) perspective.)
- **Evaluation** -- Photo or video documentation of user testing, and two or three select quotes of user reactions.
- **Future Work** -- What was a surprise at the end? Describe how you would extend or refine your project if you had more time.
