# Assignment 3: Campus AR
<br>

Form your own groups of 3~4, and choose one of the campus sites below.

-   Brownie Cafe
-   Avery Library
-   Food Trucks
-   Gym
-   Machine Shop (lasercutters, routers, etc.)

You're also welcome to pitch a location not on this list as long as it is easily (and safely) accessible, and you can identify it as a place of transaction.

Assignment outline:
-   *3.1 Needfinding*: identify a population of users, define some hypotheses, observe.
-   *3.2 Synthesis*: develop a framework to express your users and their needs.
-   *3.3 Storyboard*: design a user journey and wireframe your solution (a mixed reality experience.)
-   *3.4 Prototyping*: turn your storyboard into a prototype.
-   *3.5 Evaluation*: test your prototype with users (students) on campus.

### Week 1: Needfinding: Observe + Recruit

Look at your site as a "place of transaction”—a transaction can be financial, material, knowledge-based, or social. Choose a current site which you think embodies a usage of public space that will still be needed in the future.

Identify an interesting problem or an intervention you want to bring to life in this space. What are the goals or changes you want to facilitate? e.g. do you want to help people pass through more quickly (and perhaps leave as fast as possible),  or help them learn to identify this "space" as a "place" (per Yi-Fu Tuan) that they might want to return to? Why might your goal be best addressed through a mixed reality experience?

Next, identify a segment of users whom you’d be addressing and define their roles and needs. For example, are there buyers vs. sellers, or students vs. teachers, or first arrivers vs. latecomers, in your space? Choose some subset of these as your target audience whom you want to help. List your guesses and assumptions about what your users need and what their motivations might be. How do they solve their needs today? Are they aware it is a problem? Read [How to Understand Problems](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-understand-problems.html) by Prof. Amy Ko at University of Washington, it will help you with this exercise.

Next, observe. Spend some time in the space you chose, capturing a mix of sketches, notes, photos, and video.

Recruit **four** people that fit your target user group and send them a quick survey about their needs and current habits. Also make sure they are available to meet for 30min. with you next week. Put together a discussion guide of questions and topics you plan to cover when you do interviews next week.

Make 1 slide in our shared [A3.1 deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ez72_uERQIzPgucYiHruOfIzdSPAbJr1pVYSWYpTPYg/edit?usp=sharing) covering:
- your chosen location
- what user problem are you hoping to solve?
- how are you "turning the problem" on its head and solving it differently with emerging tech?
- 4 observation photos or videos and what you observed

Be prepared to present for 3 min. and answer questions.

### Week 2: Needfinding: Provocations + Synthesis

Based on your survey results and observations, design 6 provocations each illustrating a mixed reality experience or one aspect thereof. Your provocations should evoke a response from your interviewees that will tell you something (whether positive or negative) about your assumptions.

Interview your recruits, first without any bias or expectation, and then show them your provocations and listen to what they have to say. Make sure you have an adequate system of notetaking for the interview: either one person should be dedicated to typing, or you should ask permission to record (video or voice.) This also allows you to have quotes / visuals which you can present later to communicate what you found.

Organize your findings. What surprised you? What do your users need? What are their pain points? Don't restrict your focus to just what people say and do, reflect also on what they think and feel. Create a few personas that capture the main users groups you've identified. Is there an overall framework you can use to guide future product design?

Next, synthesize everything you've learned so far. Read [How to Define Problems](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-define-problems.html), it will help you with this section.

Finally, translate your needs into [How Might We...?](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/how-might-we-questions) questions. Aim for around six questions.

Present your goals, personas, scenarios, and "How Might We" questions for a [6 min. presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11zcwDkg32pZBGMI3PbtHPSN0TQdYIxqQTcOqkdK_2IM/edit?usp=sharing) in class.

### Week 3: Prototyping: Storyboard

Brainstorm and design three divergent mixed reality experiences to address the users in your space. Illustrate and narrate the user experience through storyboards. Employ frameworks or user journeys as needed to convey your ideas.

Make sure your storyboard communicates:
-   Characters (who?)
-   Setting (environment)
-   Sequence (what task, how to start, what steps to use)
-   Satisfaction (motivation, end result, what need)

Present your storyboard in 1 slide / 3min. in our shared [A3.3 deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mD_90XHjR827TeHmYJLK4-uZpqeH_uBHKPP3eOBHcfM/edit?usp=sharing).

### Week 4: Prototyping: Implement

Choose one of your concepts to refine, decide on an appropriate prototyping method, and build it!

### Week 5: Evaluating: User Test

Test your prototype with at least four people: you can either return to the same recruits you interviewed earlier, or test with users who have never seen your provocations to capture fresh impressions. As during the earlier interviews, document their reactions and responses.

Compile everything about your campus project for midterm crits and be prepared to present for 10 min. Send your slides by *6pm* on March 11th to Adam (akv2118). Hard deadline!
