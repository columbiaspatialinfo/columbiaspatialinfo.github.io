# Assignment 4: Final Project
<br>

As mixed reality technologies seem to remove more and more of the need for people to meet in person, what are reasons to continue to interact with each other in physical space?

How could the design of the digital user experience work in tandem with the built environment, which is likely "smart" and "modular", etc., to facilitate desireable interactions?

What is the information experience in cities of the future?

Site selection will be by assignment according to your ranked preferences; our goal is to ensure both that we explore a variety of directions as a class, and everyone is excited about what they're working on.

We will then introduce you to professionals with topic-area expertise, e.g. an information architect at the MTA.
