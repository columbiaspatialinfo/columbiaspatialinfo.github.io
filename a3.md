# Assignment 3: Campus AR
<br>

Form your own groups of 3~4, and choose one of the campus sites below.

-   Brownie Cafe
-   Avery Library
-   Food Trucks
-   Gym
-   Machine Shop (i.e. one with lasercutters, routers, etc.)

You're also welcome to pitch a location not on this list as long as it is easily (and safely) accessible, and you can identify it as a usage of public space that will still be needed in the future.

Assignment outline:
-   *3.1 Needfinding*: identify a population of users, define some hypotheses, observe.
-   *3.2 Synthesis*: develop a framework to express your users and their needs.
-   *3.3 Storyboard*: design a user journey and wireframe your solution (a mixed reality experience.)
-   *3.4 Prototyping*: turn your storyboard into a prototype.
-   *3.5 Evaluation*: test your prototype with users (students) on campus.

### Week 1: Needfinding

Choose a current site which you think embodies a usage of public space that will still be needed in the future.

Identify an interesting problem or an intervention you want to bring to life in this space. What are the goals or changes you want to facilitate? e.g. do you want to help people pass through more quickly (and perhaps leave as fast as possible),  or help them learn to identify this "space" as a "place" (via Yi-Fu Tuan) that they might want to return to? Why might your goal be best addressed through a mixed reality experience? What types of information (Identification, Directional, Orientation, Regulatory, etc., via David Gibson) will your emerging technology experience provide? Make sure to focus on designing an experience that does one thing (or adheres to one theme) very well, rather than an app that does many things.

Next, identify a segment of users whom you’d be addressing and define their roles and needs. For example, are there buyers vs. sellers, or students vs. teachers, or first arrivers vs. latecomers, in your space? Choose some subset of these as your target audience whom you want to help. List your guesses and assumptions about what your users need and what their motivations might be. How do they solve their needs today? Are they aware it is a problem? Read [How to Understand Problems](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-understand-problems.html) by Prof. Amy Ko at University of Washington, it will help you with this exercise.

Next, observe. Spend some time in the space you chose, capturing a mix of sketches, notes, photos, and video.

Recruit **four** people that fit your target user group and send them a quick survey about their needs and current habits. Also make sure they are available to meet for 30min. with you next week. Put together a discussion guide of questions and topics you plan to cover when you do interviews next week.

By 6pm before class, [submit](https://forms.gle/29iuSrE17RSACpcB7) 3 slides covering:
1. your chosen location
2. what user problem are you hoping to solve?
3. how are you "turning the problem" on its head and solving it differently with emerging tech?
4. four observation photos or videos and one insight/learning for each

Be prepared to present for 3 min. and answer questions.

### Week 2: Synthesis

Based on your survey results and observations, design 6 provocations each illustrating a mixed reality experience or one aspect thereof. Your provocations should evoke a response from your interviewees that will tell you something (whether positive or negative) about your assumptions.

Interview your recruits, first without any bias or expectation, and then show them your provocations and listen to what they have to say. Make sure you have an adequate system of notetaking for the interview: either one person should be dedicated to typing, or you should ask permission to record (video or voice.) This also allows you to have quotes / visuals which you can present later to communicate what you found.

Organize your findings. What surprised you? What do your users need? What are their pain points? Don't restrict your focus to just what people say and do, reflect also on what they think and feel. Create a few personas that capture the main users groups you've identified. Is there an overall framework you can use to guide future product design?

Next, synthesize everything you've learned so far. Read [How to Define Problems](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-define-problems.html), it will help you with this section.

Finally, translate your needs into [How Might We...?](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/how-might-we-questions) questions. Aim for six questions.

Present your goals, personas, framework, and "How Might We" questions for a 6 min. presentation in class. [Submit](https://forms.gle/29iuSrE17RSACpcB7) your slides by 6pm.

### Week 3: Storyboard

Brainstorm and design three divergent mixed reality experiences to address the users in your space. Illustrate and narrate the user experience through storyboards. Employ frameworks or user journeys as needed to convey your ideas.

Make sure each storyboard communicates:
-   Characters (who?)
-   Setting (environment)
-   Sequence (what task, how to start, what steps to use)
-   Satisfaction (motivation, end result, what need)

Present your three storyboards in 3 slides / 3min. [Submit](https://forms.gle/29iuSrE17RSACpcB7) your slides by 6pm.

### Week 4: Prototyping

Choose one of your concepts to refine, decide on an appropriate prototyping method, and build it!

### Week 5: Evaluating

Test your prototype with at least four people: you can either return to the same recruits you interviewed earlier, or test with users who have never seen your provocations to capture fresh impressions. As during the earlier interviews, document their reactions and responses.

Compile everything about your campus project for midterm crits and be prepared to present for 10 min. [Submit](https://forms.gle/29iuSrE17RSACpcB7) your slides by 6pm.

Your presentation should cover these topics (though you need not label or divide your sections exactly thus):

- **Introduction** -- A succinct explanation of your chosen user information problem in public space, and the motivation for solving it in AR.
- **Related Work** -- 2~3 examples of prior work or inspiration related to your project.
- **User Insights** -- Summarize what you learned about your users and the framework you defined to guide your design decisions.
- **Proposed Solution** -- One-sentence "poster" description of the experience you designed, and a user journey diagram capturing the whole experience.
- **Demo Video** -- One or two video examples of using your prototype, from a first person (user) perspective.
- **Evaluation** -- Photo or video documentation of user testing, and summary of (including quotes from) user reactions.
- **Future Work** -- What was a surprise at the end? Describe how you would extend or refine your project.
